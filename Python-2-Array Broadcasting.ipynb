    "# Array Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a mechanism for performing mathematical operations on arrays of unequal shapes. This mechanism is known as array broadcasting or broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Broadcasting Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "When operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing (i.e., rightmost) dimensions and works its way left. Two dimensions are compatible when\n",
    "\n",
    "- they are equal, or\n",
    "\n",
    "- one of them is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If these conditions are not met, following exception is thrown: \n",
    "\n",
    "        ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together  \n",
    "\n",
    "It indicates that the arrays have incompatible shapes. The size of the resulting array is the size that is not 1 along each axis of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
